**Develop flexible and powerful CI/CD pipelines using Tekton Pipelines and Triggers**

## What is this book about?
Tekton is a powerful yet flexible Kubernetes-native open-source framework for creating continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) systems. It enables you to build, test, and deploy across multiple cloud providers or on-premise systems. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the basic principles behind CI/CD
* Explore what tasks are and how they can be made reusable and flexible
* Focus on how to use Tekton objects to compose a robust pipeline
* Share data across a pipeline using volumes and workspaces
* Discover more advanced topics such as WhenExpressions and Secrets to build complex pipelines
* Understand what Tekton Triggers are and how they can be used to automate CI/CD pipelines
* Build a full CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys an application to a Kubernetes cluster when an update is done to a code repository
